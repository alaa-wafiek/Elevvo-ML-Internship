# Elevvo-ML-Internship
Machine Learning projects completed during my 1-month internship, covering regression, classification, clustering, recommender systems, and computer vision

📂 Projects
1.  Student Score Prediction

Built a regression model (Linear & Polynomial) to predict students’ exam scores.

Explored relationships between study hours, participation, and other factors.

Tech stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

2.  Customer Segmentation

Applied K-Means clustering and tested DBSCAN to segment customers based on income and spending.

Visualized clusters and analyzed spending behavior per group.

Tech stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

3.  Loan Approval Prediction

Built a classification model to predict loan approvals.

Handled imbalanced data using SMOTE and tested Decision Trees vs Logistic Regression.

Evaluated performance with precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tech stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

4.  Movie Recommendation System

Developed a collaborative filtering system using the MovieLens dataset.

Implemented user-user similarity, item-based filtering, and Matrix Factorization (SVD).

Evaluated recommendations with Precision@K.

Tech stack: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn

5.  Traffic Sign Recognition

Built a deep learning CNN model to classify traffic signs (GTSRB dataset).

Preprocessed images (resizing, normalization) and used data augmentation.

Evaluated model with accuracy and confusion matrix.

Tech stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
